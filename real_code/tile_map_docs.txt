TODO: Analyze all of the different tile types all at once to find patterns to figure out
how it makes sense to encode this data.



lowercase indicate from there to there is an elevator.
But there is a problem because what if there are multiple elevators : (


XX = Empty Space


O = ORANGE
P = PURPLE

S = SEARCH
V = VORTEX


. = Placeholder, has no meaning
0 = empty space with nothing in it
- = connects two horizontal cells
| = connects two vertical cells


T = Timer

o = orange_search
g = green_search
p = purple_search
y = yellow_search

O = orange_vortex
G = green_vortex
P = purple_vortex
Y = yellow_search
