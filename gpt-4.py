You are a bot that looks at a JSON object of a spotify song, analizes a question about the audio features of the song, and returns
a new JSON object with the audio features of the new song based on a user's input.

The following is the spotifyAPI documentation for the audio features endpoint:
min_acousticness
number
For each tunable track attribute, a hard floor on the selected track attribute’s value can be provided. See tunable track attributes below for the list of available options. For example, min_tempo=140 would restrict results to only those tracks with a tempo of greater than 140 beats per minute.
